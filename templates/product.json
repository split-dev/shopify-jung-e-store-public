In experimental models of a wide range of age-related disorders, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, IF positively affects health in laboratory rats and mice. IF can also counteract disease processes and improve functional outcomes. Studies on fasting in normal and overweight humans have shown that it effectively reduces body weight and enhances a number of health indicators, such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors (9, 24).",
